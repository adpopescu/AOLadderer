These are all the ladder implants we need to consider, organized by slot, and then by ladder clusters.
The implants in each group go in the same slot, and have the same ladder clusters, but require different
abilities. For example, there are many Eye implants that add to Intelligence. They can be made to
require Agility, Intelligence, Psychic, or Sense, by choosing certain non-ladder clusters. There are many
different ways to combine non-ladder clusters with the Eye's bright Intelligence cluster to yield one
of those ability requirements. Out of all those ways, I chose a single one for each ability requirement,
so whenever we need a ladder implant like Eye, adding to Intelligence, requiring Sense, we always build
it from the same clusters. Could end up saving some work if we see we already have an implant like
that built. The one I chose has a Pistol faded cluser, which could come in handy for other twinking goals.
Now, if there was a ladder implant that added to Intelligence and Psychic, and required Sense, there would
be no reason to build the one that only adds to Intelligence. The main work in creating this file was
removing those redundant ladder implants, with the same slot and ability requirement as another ladder
implant, but only a subset of the ladder clusters. The secondary work was choosing which ladder implant
from each {slot+ladder clusters+ability requirement} group to choose as the standard. Doesn't matter
as far as the ladderer is concerned, but I preferred maximizing empties, then choosing something useful
for weapon swaps, then choosing something in alphabetical order. When the ladderer runs, it considers
{slot+ladder clusters} groups. When doing that, it always chooses the implant with the ability requirement
the user has the most in. The ability requirement is the only way the implants differ (as far as the
ladderer is concerned), so choosing the one with the ability requirement the user has the most in is obvious.
There are scenarios where one group makes another group irrelevant. For example, if the user has equal or more
Agility than Psychic, the Psychic and Sense adding head, requiring Agility, would be better than the Psychic
adding head, requiring Psychic. If the user has more Psychic than Agility, the head requiring Psychic and
adding only to Psychic may be better than the head requiring Agility and adding to both Psychic and Sense.
